- 👋 Hi, I’m ShivaKondapalli
- 👀 I’m interested in theoretical and mathematical aspects of Machine Learning. I believe that having a good understanding of these opaque machines will pay great practical
dividends in the future. Or in the words of Vladimir Vapnik: "Nothing is more practical than a good theory"
- 🌱 I’m currently learning Deep Learning, TDA, algebraic statistics, Reinforcement learning, causality, information geometry and whatever new math that fascinates me. 
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on areas at the intersection of Deep learning and the above fields I just mentioned. 
- 📫 You can reachh me at https://www.linkedin.com/in/shivakondapalli/ or my email 1993ksk@gmail.com
